    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I've taken my first steps in the open-source world: I became a committer to the <a href="http://gradlefx.org/">GradleFx</a> project.</p>

<h2>What project say you?</h2>

<p><a href="http://gradlefx.org/">GradleFx</a> is an automated build tool for building Flex and ActionScript applications. It's a plugin for <a href="http://gradle.org/">Gradle</a>,
which is an alternative to the ubiquitous <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>. Actually calling it an alternative would not be doing it justice:
it's <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>, <a href="http://ant.apache.org/ivy/">Ivy</a> and <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">ANT</a> mixed up and put on <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">steroids</a>.</p>

<p>Until <a href="http://gradlefx.org/">GradleFx</a> came to the scene, us poor Flex developers only had <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flex-mojos/">FlexMojos</a> (a <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> plugin with the
same goal) at their disposal. And truth be said: it has some <em>very</em> annoying bugs. So when I discovered <a href="http://gradlefx.org/">GradleFx</a> I
was delighted.</p>

<p>When I first gave <a href="http://gradlefx.org/">GradleFx</a> a try, I got a few builds up and running in no time. Unfortunately, I soon found out
that <a href="http://gradlefx.org/">GradleFx</a> - being a fairly young project - was missing a few pieces. But since <a href="http://gradle.org/">Gradle</a> was designed to
be an easily extensible framework, I worked my way around those shortcomings with some custom tasks.</p>

<h2>First steps</h2>

<p>I soon discovered that <a href="http://gradlefx.org/">GradleFx</a>' codebase was fairly transparent (as opposed to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flex-mojos/">FlexMojos</a>'). So I forked the
project on <a href="https://github.com/GradleFx/GradleFx">GitHub</a> and I started adding some minor features. <a href="https://github.com/SlevinBE">Yennick</a>, one of the founders and currently the
only active committer, seemed to like my ideas. He merged them into the codebase rather quickly, encouraged me to keep
on contributing and before I knew what happened, I became part of the 'team'.</p>

<h2>Contributions</h2>

<p>So far I've added only a few minor improvements:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <code>theme</code> dependency scope: well, it was missing</li>
<li>localization conventions: use localized .properties files with zero configuration</li>
<li>the <code>frameworkLinkage</code> convention: a possibility to determine how the Flex framework is linked into the application</li>
</ul>


<p>Coming up:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <code>flashbuilder</code> plugin that generates a FlashBuilder project with all the dependencies on its build path</li>
</ul>

    <updated>2012-02-20T14:18:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.riastar.net/2012/02/20/copying-instance-properties</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've lost count on how many times I've needed this in RIA development with Flex or ActionScript: the possibility to
quickly copy property values from one class instance to another. The two most important uses I can think of right now
are these:</p>

<ul>
<li>You send a value object (VO) to the server. It comes back with a bunch of additional data. So far so good. But what
you get back is another instance than the one you've just sent up the wire. Since the original instance may already be
referenced somewhere in the application we do not want to simply replace it. We want the original instance filled with
the new property values.</li>
<li>You show the user a form with which he can edit a VO. After he's changed some values he can either commit his changes
('OK' button) or discard them ('cancel' button). In this scenario you'll usually keep a copy of the original VO
somewhere handy because you want to be able to restore it when needed. Now the story is the same as the previous one:
we want to restore the values of the original instance, not replace it entirely.</li>
</ul>


<p>So I finally made this convenience method that uses <a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/utils/package.html#describeType%28%29%22">describeType()</a> for introspection as an addition to my
<code>ObjectUtil</code> class:</p>

<p>``` actionscript3
public static function copyProperties(source:Object, target:Object):void {</p>

<pre><code>if (!source || !target) return;

//copy properties declared in Class definition
var sourceInfo:XML = describeType(source);
var propertyLists:Array = [sourceInfo.variable, sourceInfo.accessor];

for each (var propertyList:XMLList in propertyLists) {
    for each (var property:XML in propertyList) {
        if (property.@access == undefined ||
            property.@access == "readwrite")
        {
            var name:String = property.@name;
            if (target.hasOwnProperty(name))
                target[name] = source[name];
        }
    }
}

//copy dynamic properties
for (name in source)
    if (target.hasOwnProperty(name))
        target[name] = source[name];
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>I have needed this so many times I find it hard to fathom why something similar is not included in the
<a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/mx/utils/ObjectUtil.html">mx.utils.ObjectUtil class</a>. It marries perfectly with <a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/mx/utils/ObjectUtil.html#clone%28%29">ObjectUtils.clone()</a>.</p>

<p>A simple example:
```actionscript3
var editableItem:MyClass = ObjectUtil.clone(originalItem);</p>

<p>//the user edits editableItem
//if he cancels we just discard this instance
//if he commits his changes we copy the new values
ObjectUtil.copyProperties(editableItem, originalItem);
```</p>

    <link href="http://blog.riastar.net/2012/01/29/gigs-easier-actionscript-event-handling/"/>
    <updated>2012-01-29T13:07:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.riastar.net/2012/01/29/gigs-easier-actionscript-event-handling</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some time ago I created Protection. It was a library intended to help me write more readable ActionScript code without
breaking out of the paradigms that were set out by Adobe. You can find a more thorough explanation and motivation in
<a href="http://blog.riastar.net/development/protection-actionscript-guarding/">an article I wrote earlier this year</a>. I have been using it a lot now and as much as I like the basic idea, I came
to realise that I had made a few wrong decisions. Most importantly:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>overcomplicated nomenclature</em>: in a silly attempt at originality I used military metaphors throughout the library
(Sentries, Captains, Spies, etc.). These names make the code actually less transparent to someone who doesn't know
where they originated (i.e. anyone but me). This is in clear violation with my original intent: more readable code.</li>
<li><em>too many optional arguments</em>: a lot of different configuration was passed through one method with a bunch of
optional arguments. Again, this would not be transparent to someone who read such code for the first time.</li>
<li><em>used inheritance (instead of composition)</em> to add the functionality to custom components</li>
<li><em>string-based conditionals</em>: <code>"r:propertyA", "f:propertyB"</code> to pass 'propertyA' to the result handler and 'propertyB'
to the failure handler? Not so pretty.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Enter Gigs</strong> (a.k.a RIAstar events)</p>

<p>So I decided to rethink the whole thing. To start with, the library name will remain my only attempt at originality.
But let's get down to the real stuff. This is how you use Gigs for tracking native Events:</p>

<p>``` actionscript3
follow(submitButton).by(MouseEvent.CLICK).handle(submit);</p>

<p>private function submit():void {</p>

<pre><code>//do some submitting
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>You can also join a 'gigs.properties' file to the application in which you can associate default event types to specific
classes. For instance 95% of the time on Buttons we listen for CLICK events. So we register a default for that:</p>

<p><code>properties
spark.components.supportClasses.ButtonBase = click
</code></p>

<p>And then we can write the following to do the same thing as before:
<code>actionscript3
follow(submitButton).handle(submit);
//we can still explicitely listen for
//another event than the registered default
follow(submitButton).by(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN).handle(startDrag);
</code></p>

<p><strong>Passing property values</strong></p>

<p>The 'handle' method takes one additional ...rest argument to which you can pass all the event properties you want pass
to the result handler. For example (I've registered the ListBase class with the IndexChangeEvent.CHANGE event type):</p>

<p>``` actionscript3
follow(itemList).handle(editItemAt, "newIndex");</p>

<p>private function editItemAt(index:int):void {</p>

<pre><code> //open item editor
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p><strong>Unfollowing</strong> (a.k.a. removing event listeners)</p>

<p>There are three ways to stop following Events.</p>

<p>Very specifically:
<code>actionscript3
unfollow(submitButton).by(MouseEvent.CLICK).handle(submit);
</code></p>

<p>Somewhat specifically (this will remove all event handlers that react to a CLICK event):
<code>actionscript3
unfollow(submitButton).by(MouseEvent.CLICK).all();
</code></p>

<p>Loose cannon (removes all event listeners for all event types for the given IEventDispatcher):
<code>actionscript3
unfollow(submitButton).all();
</code></p>

<p><strong>To be continued</strong></p>

<p>That's it for now. I have yet to recreate all functionality that existed in Protection, but I will hopefully get to
that soon.</p>
